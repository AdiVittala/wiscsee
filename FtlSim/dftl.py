Notes for DFTL design

Components
- block pool: it should have free list, used data blocks and used translation
  blocks. We should be able to find out the next free block from here. The DFTL
  paper does not mention a in-RAM data structure like this. How do they find
  out the next free block?
- Cached Mapping Table (CMT): this class should do the following:
    - have logical page <-> physical page mapping entries.
    - be able to translation LPN to PPN and PPN to LPN
    - implement a replacement policy
    - has a size() method to output the size of the CMT, so we know it does not
      exceed the size of SRAM
    - be able to add one entry
    - be able to remove one entry
    - be able to find the proper entry to be moved.
    - be able to set the number of entries allows by size
    - be able to set the number of entries directly
    - be able to fetch a mapping entry (this need to consult the Global
      Translation Directory)
    - be able to evict one entrie to flash
    - be able to evict entries to flash in batch

    - CMT interacts with
        - Flash: to save and read translation pages
        - block pool: to find free block to evict translation pages
        - Global Translation Directory: to find out where the translation pages
          are (so you can read/write), also, you need to update GTD when evicting
          pages to flash.
        - bitmap???

- Global Translation Directory, this should do the following:
    - maintains the locations of translation pages
    - given a Virtual Translation Page Number, find out the physical
      translation page number
    - given a Logical Data Page Number, find out the physical data page number

    - GTD should be a pretty passive class, it interacts with
        - CMT. When CMT changes the location of translation pages, GTD should
          be updated to reflect the changes

- Garbage Collector
    - clean data blocks: to not interrupt current writing of pages, garbage
      collector should have its own appending point to write the garbage
      collected data
    - clean translation blocks. This cleaning should also have its own
      appending point.
    - NOTE: the DFTL paper says DFTL also have partial merge and switch merge,
      I need to read their code to find out why.

    - How the garbage collector should interact with other components?
        - this cleaner will use free blocks and make used block free, so it
          will need to interact with block pool to move blocks between
          different lists.
        - the cleaner also need to interact with CMT because it may move
          translation pages around
        - the cleaner also need to interact with bitmap because it needs to
          find out the if a page is valid or not.  It also need to find out the
          invalid ratio of the blocks
        - the cleaner also need to update the global translation directory
          since it moved pages.
        - NOTE: all the classes above should a provide an easy interface for
          the cleaner to use, so the cleaner does not need to use the low-level
          interfaces to implement these functions

- Appending points: there should be several appending points:
    - appending point for writing translation page
    - appending point for writing data page
    - appending ponit for garbage collection
    - NOTE: these points should be maintained by block pool.
